# Alloy Carbonized
This Titanium Project does a simple speedtest between the code as it is produced by Alloy now and how it COULD be, using Carbon (or a simular method) for batching UI construction calls to minimize the number of trips from JS to native-land and thus possibly gain more speed.

## Usage
1. Built the app.
   * The Alloy-plugin is disabled in `tiapp.xml` to prevent it from overwriting the `Resources` folder, since I made the necessary changes for the tests in the code initially produced by Alloy in there.
2. Repeatately click all three buttons, at least twice.
   * After each click, a simple window containing 1000 views of 9x9 pixels will be created. Click on the window to close it. The fastest score will be shown in the button title.

## Tests
The app consists of three tests. Each button triggers another test. Each test creates the same window, but in a different way:

1. Alloy
   * Code as generated by Alloy, based on the `orginal` controller, view and style found in the project's `alloy` folder. Plain `Ti.UI.createâ€¦()` calls like you know it.
2. Alloy + Inline Carbon
   * Adapted code that uses a single call to `Carbon.UI.create()` to construct the window and all it's 1000 views at once.
3. Alloy + JSON Carbon
   * Adapted code that uses `Carbon.UI.load()` to load `/Resources/alloy/views/json.json`, which defines the window and all it's 1000 views.
